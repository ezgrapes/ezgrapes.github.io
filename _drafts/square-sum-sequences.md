In [The Square-Sum Problem](https://youtu.be/G1m7goLCJDY) from [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/user/numberphile), Matt Parker discusses a problem involving permutations the first $n$ positive integers where consecutive terms sum to a perfect square. He's particularly interested in whether, for sufficiently large $n$, there exists a permutation with the square sum property. His problem can be viewed through the lens of graph theory in terms of Hamilton paths. The property of summing to a perfect square is a symmetric relation on the set of integers, and the set of positive integers admits a symmetric relation $R$ defined by $aRb$ if $a + b$ is a perfect square.

My slant is more computational: is there an inductive way to generate a square sum sequence that is a perumation of the positive integers?
